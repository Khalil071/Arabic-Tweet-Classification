Arabic Tweet Classification using Transfer Learning
This project applies transfer learning techniques to classify Arabic tweets using Keras. A pre-trained model is fine-tuned for the task of classifying tweets into predefined categories, leveraging the power of Keras’ Sequential API.

Project Overview
Dataset: The dataset consists of labeled Arabic tweets, categorized into different classes such as sentiment or topics.
Model: The model utilizes a transfer learning approach with a pre-trained embedding layer to extract features from the Arabic text, followed by a fine-tuned Keras Sequential model for tweet classification.
Purpose: The objective is to classify Arabic tweets into predefined categories efficiently using transfer learning to improve accuracy and training efficiency.

Dataset
The dataset should contain Arabic tweets and their respective labels. The data is expected to have at least the following columns:

tweet: The Arabic tweet text.
label: The category label for the tweet.
Transfer Learning Approach
Pretrained Embedding Layer: In this model, a pre-trained word embedding layer is used to map Arabic words to dense vectors. These embeddings are kept frozen initially to preserve their learned features, allowing the model to leverage general language patterns.
Keras Sequential Model: The model is built using Keras’ Sequential API, where the pre-trained embeddings are fine-tuned for tweet classification.
Fine-tuning: The embedding layer is set to non-trainable in the initial stages. The rest of the layers, including LSTM and Dense layers, are trained to adapt to the tweet classification task.
Model Architecture
Embedding Layer: Uses pre-trained word embeddings to represent Arabic text.
LSTM Layer: Captures the sequential nature of tweets, enabling the model to understand the context and dependencies in the text.
Dense Layer: The final layer predicts the classification output for each tweet.

from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense, Embedding, LSTM

# Define the Keras Sequential model
model = Sequential()

# Add the embedding layer with pre-trained embeddings
model.add(Embedding(input_dim=vocab_size,
                    output_dim=embedding_dim,
                    input_length=max_len,
                    trainable=False))  # Freeze the embedding layer initially

# Add LSTM layer for sequence learning
model.add(LSTM(128, dropout=0.2, recurrent_dropout=0.2))

# Add the output layer with sigmoid activation (for binary classification)
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

# Compile the model
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=5, batch_size=64, validation_data=(X_val, y_val))
Results
Once the model is trained, evaluate it using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. You can also visualize the performance of the model by plotting the training and validation loss and accuracy over the epochs.
